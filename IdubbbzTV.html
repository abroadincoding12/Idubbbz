	<h1> Idubbbz </h1>
	<p> Idubbbz (real name Ian Carter) is an American vlogger and social media critic best known for his Kickstarter Crap and Content Cop web series. In addition to producing original video content, iDubbbz has made guest appearances in collaboration with other YouTube personalities, most notably Filthy Frank and Maxmoefoe. On August 30th, 2012, iDubbbz posted the first video to the iDubbbzTV YouTube channel, in which he is shown playing the game Overgrowth. In the beginning of his YouTube career, iDubbbz built his audience base through a series of Let’s Play-style walkthroughs and video game commentaries, before shifting his focus to more in-depth commentaries on social media trends and analysis of YouTube’s vlogging subculture with the launch of Kickstarter Crap in March 2013, followed by the premiere of Content Cop in December 2015. Many of his early videos have since been removed from the channel. As of February 2017, iDubbbzTV has more than 3.5 million subscribers on YouTube.</p>
